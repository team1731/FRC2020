The first phase of each MATCH is called Autonomous (AUTO) and consists of the first fifteen (0:15) seconds. During AUTO, ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE TEAM control or input. ROBOTS attempt to score POWER CELLS in POWER PORTS, retrieve additional POWER CELLS from around the FIELD, and exit the infinite vertical volume created by the corresponding ALLIANCE’S INITIATION LINE any time before the end of the phase.


Each TEAM stages their ROBOT such that at least part of its BUMPERS are intersecting the infinite vertical volume created by the corresponding ALLIANCE’S INITIATION LINE.
If order placement matters to either or both ALLIANCES, the ALLIANCE must notify the Head REFEREE during setup for that MATCH. Upon notification, the Head REFEREE will require ALLIANCES to alternate placement of all ROBOTS. In a Qualification MATCH, ROBOTS are placed in the following order: Red Station 1 ROBOT, Blue Station 1 ROBOT, Red Station 2 ROBOT, Blue Station 2 ROBOT, Red Station 3 ROBOT, Blue Station 3 ROBOT. In a PLAYOFF MATCH, the same pattern is applied, but instead of Blue ALLIANCE placing last, the higher seeded ALLIANCE (regardless of color) places last.


As the season progresses, the CAPACITY required for each Stage of the SHIELD GENERATOR may increase. While Stage CAPACITY will not change between weeks of Regional or District Competition play, the Stage CAPACITY may be changed for District Championship and/or FIRST Championship play. Teams will be notified of changes in Stage CAPACITY no later than the scheduled Team Update prior to the date of the event.

POWER CELLS scored after a stage is at CAPACITY generate MATCH points but do not contribute to the next stage’s CAPACITY. POWER CELLS scored after Stage 3 is ACTIVATED continue to generate MATCH points.

A ROBOT is considered PARKED if, at the conclusion of the MATCH, it is fully supported (either directly or transitively) by the SHIELD GENERATOR and not in contact with any carpet outside its ALLIANCE’S RENDEZVOUS POINT, but without having met the criteria for HANGING.
A ROBOT is considered HANGING if, five (5) seconds after the ARENA timer displays zero (0) following TELEOP, it is fully supported (either directly or transitively) by its GENERATOR SWITCH.
A GENERATOR SWITCH is considered LEVEL if, five (5) seconds after the ARENA timer displays zero (0) following TELEOP, both following criteria are met:
A. it is in the LEVEL range, and
B. all ALLIANCE ROBOTS contacting the GENERATOR SWITCH are HANGING.


At each event, the ARENA will be open for at least thirty (30) minutes prior to the start of Qualification MATCHES, during which time teams may survey and/or measure the ARENA and bring ROBOTS on the FIELD to perform sensor calibration. The specific time that the FIELD is open will be communicated to teams at the event. Teams may bring specific questions or comments to the FTA.
T1. Freeze, ROBOT. During the period when the ARENA is open for measurement, ROBOTS can be enabled, but cannot move, nor can they interact with (e.g. shoot, push, pickup, etc.) POWER CELLS, POWER PORTS, GENERATOR SWITCHES, CONTROL PANELS, or other FIELD elements.

SECTOR A 26 ft. 11¼ in. (~821 cm) wide by 10 ft. 2 in. (~310 cm) deep infinitely tall volume formed by an ALLIANCE’S ALLIANCE WALL, guardrail, and INITIATION LINE. The SECTOR includes the INITIATION LINE.
